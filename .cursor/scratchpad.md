# TimeGPT Stock Forecast Project - Simplified Approach

## Background and Motivation

Following the step-by-step guide to create a simple and effective TimeGPT stock forecasting system. The focus is on getting a working AI-powered stock prediction system up and running quickly with minimal complexity.

### Key Requirements:
- Simple project structure with `src/` folder
- Three core modules: data collection, forecasting, and visualization
- Easy-to-follow workflow for downloading data, generating forecasts, and viewing results
- Support for multiple stock symbols (AAPL, TSLA, GOOGL, etc.)

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Technical Challenges:
1. **Environment Setup**: Ensuring Python packages are installed correctly
2. **API Configuration**: Setting up NIXTLA_API_KEY environment variable
3. **Data Flow**: Ensuring data flows correctly between modules (CSV files)
4. **Visualization**: Creating clear charts showing historical vs predicted prices

### Current State Analysis:
- ‚úÖ Project structure created with src/ folder
- ‚úÖ All three core Python modules implemented
- ‚úÖ README.md with clear instructions created
- ‚è≥ Need to test the complete workflow
- ‚è≥ Need to verify API key setup and dependencies

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

**Current Status**: Project structure is ready, but encountered Python environment issue during testing.

**Issue Encountered**: 
- Python is not installed or not in the system PATH
- Commands `python`, `py`, and `python3` are not recognized
- Need to install Python before proceeding with testing

**Next Steps**: 
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Install Python on the system or add it to PATH
2. Install required packages: `pip install yfinance pandas matplotlib nixtla`
3. Test the data collection by running `python src/data_collector.py`
4. Verify that AAPL_data.csv is created successfully
5. Proceed with testing the forecasting workflow

**Success Criteria for Task 1** (Updated):
- Python is available and can be executed from command line
- Required packages are installed successfully
- `python src/data_collector.py` runs without errors
- AAPL_data.csv file is created in the project root
- CSV contains historical stock price data for Apple
- Console shows confirmation message with row count

## Lessons

### Project Management Lessons:
- Sometimes simpler is better - the step-by-step approach is more accessible
- Clear documentation and README files are crucial for usability
- Clean project structure makes it easier to understand and maintain

### Technical Lessons:
- yfinance provides easy access to historical stock data
- TimeGPT requires specific column naming: 'timestamp' and 'y'
- CSV files provide simple data exchange between modules
